Total duration: 30 minutes

Total number of children: 12

Game’s goals:

1. Apprehend dynamic websites’ concepts requiring assembly of multiple resources hosted on other servers

2. Apprehend the DNS resolver’s concept

3. Clarify positive sides of DNS filtering system (malware blocking) and its more controversial aspects (censorship of specific websites)

Material:

- Panels with children’s roles
- Envelopes
- Stamps to confirm that the different steps were respected
- Chronometer
- cat / car pictures 

Game’s rules:

Each child plays a predefined role and respect a precise continuity in order to, first of all, understand the way a website works and, then, how DNS filtering works.

The game is divided in 3 key steps:

-	Step 1: global explanations
-	Step 2: dynamic loading
-	Step 3: DNS resolver: censorship

Room’s layout:

The room is divided is 3 main areas: 1 DNS resolver area (area B), 1 server area (area C), 1 browser area (area A) (see scheme)

The players:

-	Child number 1 plays the browser’s role (AREA A) 
-	Child number 2 plays the DNS resolver’s role (AREA B)
-	Child number 3 plays the root’s role (area B)
-	Child number 4 represents “.lu” and “.fr” (area B)
-	Child number 5 represents “.com” (area B)
-	Child number 6 represents “smile.lu” and “google.com” (area B)
-	Child number 7 represents “facebook.fr” and “youtube.com” (area B)
-	Children number 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 / 12 play the resources’ role (area C)

PHASE 1 & 2

The game takes place according to this way: 

A website page is projected on a screen and children will have to rebuild this page with a kind of role play.

1/ The child number 1 (browser) has to download the website www.smile.lu/.

2/ The child number 1 (browser)  asks the number 2 child (DNS resolver) “where are the resources” for "www.smile.lu/index.html".

3/ The child number 2 (DNS resolver) asks the child number 3 (root) who owns “.lu”. The child number 3 indicates that it is child number 4 who has this answer.

4/ The child number 2 (DNS resolver) asks the child number 4 who is “smile.lu”. The child number 4 indicates that it the child number 6 who has the answer.

5/ The child number 2 (DNS resolver) asks the child number 6 who has “www.smile.lu”. The child number 6 indicates a “server child”’s number, for instance the child number 8 (at this level, we use IP addresses, example: 192.162.2.3: this shows that we can also reach a website by typing figures in the browser).

6/ The child number 2 (DNS resolver) says to the child number 1 (browser) “the child number 8 can give you the info”.

7/ The child number 1 (browser) asks resource number 8’s child “/index.html”.

9/ The “index.html” file owns resources hosted on other servers (example: pictures, videos...)

Then, the tour is again done and other websites have to be realized.

For each tour, areas must be inverted: the DNS area becomes server area and vice versa so that children can play different roles and will keep paying attention.

PHASE 3: the lying resolver (too complicated)

In this second phase, children will get familiar with controversial filtering system’s sides (censorhip) and its postive aspects which help block malware.

This phase introduces the DNS filtering’s concept. When children asks a resource, it indicates that a file is forbidden in order to help understand censorship. This phase helps children think about the “freedom of speech”’s notion. 

However, this step shows that it is also necessary to update its browser to avoid malware. In order to demonstrate this problematic, one child plays the role of the updated browser whereas another child plays the role of a non updated browser: children will quickly understand why updates are relevant. 

Finally, in order to introduce malware in the game, the child number 5 will be asked to give wrong answers to the other children.

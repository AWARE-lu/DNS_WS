# Phase 4

## Preparation
* Number of participants *: 16 children (max), divided into 3 groups and 1 animator (without prejudice to local laws and regulations)
*Equipment*:
* 3 canvas to complete
* 3 sets of cards (6 cards per set) representing each of the resources to be assembled
* 1 video projector

## Detailed Objectives
The educational objectives are as follows:
* Understand the concept of botnet
* Understand the concept of distributed denial of service
* Understand the concept of Single Point of Failure represented by the DNS


## Concepts covered
The concepts addressed during this phase are as follows:
* Botnet
* Saturation


The following keywords will allow the trainer to deepen the subject by himself on the Internet:
DNS, botnet, malware, Denial of service, DDoS

The following definitions may be useful
* DNS: Domain Name System, Domain Naming System. Allows to associate the name of a server (ex: www.facebook.com) with an IP address (ex: 251.26.54.5)
* Botnet: network of infected computers become bots, or zombies, and used by criminals for actions like DDOS
* Denial of service: malicious action to saturate a query server to prevent it from responding to legitimate queries
* DDoS: Distributed Denial of Service. Thousands, even millions of machines are used to achieve a simultaneous Denial of Service on the same target.

## Outside Context
This workshop will introduce the networks of infected computers (Botnet) and their actions of denial of service. Currently, DDoS attacks can neutralize services like DNS (we can think of the October 22, 2016 attack against the DNS of the company DYN which paralyzed some of the sites like Twitter, PSN, etc .: http://www.numerama.com/tech/203154-panique-aux-usa-des-dizaines-de-sites-web-inaccessibles-apres-une-attaque-ddos.html).


## Processing
As in Phase 3, the children have a framework to be completed by group, and the model they chose in Phase 2 projected by video projector. The groups of children are divided between two Blue-Team and one Red-Team. The objective, known publicly, of each group of the Blue-Team is to constitute as quickly as possible his puzzle.

During a passage, the group interviewed asks for its play to the resolver DNS played by the animator. The latter answers him and gives the piece. The Red-Team will then perform a number of illegitimate queries corresponding to the X number of complete patterns found for that group in step 3. The leader then passes the turn of the following X groups.

The facilitator can then present the issues of distributed denial of service aimed at the DNS servers and the crucial aspect of the DNS server without which no service is accessible.

# Phase 2

## Preparation
* Number of participants *: 16 children (max), divided into 3 groups and 1 animator 

*Equipment*:
* 3 canvas to complete
* 3 sets of cards (6 cards per set) representing each of the resources to be assembled
* 1 video projector

## Detailed Objectives
The educational objectives are as follows:
* Understand the concept of resource filtering
* Collaborative creation in hackaton mode
* Pitch of a project

## Concepts covered
The concepts addressed during this phase are as follows:
* Filter specific resources
* DNS naming system


The following keywords will allow the trainer to deepen the subject by himself on the Internet:
DNS, resolver, external resources, IP address, domain name, FQDN, blacklist

The following definitions may be useful
* DNS: Domain Name System, Domain Naming System. Allows to associate the name of a server (ex: www.facebook.com) with an IP address (ex: 251.26.54.5)
* Resolver: server performing the association between domain name and IP address
* IP address: identifier of a computer-based Internet Protocol), such as a telephone number
* FQDN: Fully Qualified Domain Name. Designation of a host (or machine) on r on the Internet network (IP means a domain.) The schema is then hote.domaine.tld
* Domain: set of computers linked

## Outside Context
This workshop is an opportunity to discuss the problems of filtering by a third party (a state or a company) of resources that render a site inaccessible. Examples include online gambling sites in France (ARJEL) or filtering social networks in states such as Turkey.

## Processing
Children have a list of resources available for creating their own web service. Practically, children have a terminal-shaped canvas (smartphone or tablet) and resources in the form of puzzle pieces. The aim is to assemble the pieces on the canvas so as to fill it in a coherent way. These resources include social interactions (Twitter, Facebook), but also video readers, online sales, etc. The goal is for each team to think, as in a Hackaton, about a web service that will then have to be pitched in front of all the groups.
Children then vote for the best web service, the one that will be used in the third phase.
At this point, the facilitator may decide to censor a particular type of resources (for example, selling candy), for reasons to be explained (in this case, the health of children). This is the introduction of the concept of censorship by a third party.

Once the constitution is chosen by the children and validated by the animator, the latter can project on the video projector the model which will then be completed in phase 3.

When all groups of children have completed their canvas, the facilitator then presents the second phase.

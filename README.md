# DNS_WS
New DNS workshop

Goal:
Create a 1 hour long game focused on explaining to 16 (max) children aged 8-12 years old divided in 3 groups the basic technical functionning of DNS, how DNS can be controlled, how it can be abused. Focus as much on fun than on technical content.

This WS is a collaborative creation between Savety and Securitymadein.lu. 
Co-Authors (non exhaustive list): 
- Loic Peden (savety)
- Matthieu Farcot (Securitymadein.lu)
- Emilie Muller (Securitymadein.lu)

Project co-financed BY EU, Connecting Europe Facility

The game is divided in 4 main steps.

Step 1:

- Introduce children with the DNS concept
- Let the children connect to a website and show them Lightbeam outcomes : children can understand that 1 website have connection with other websites
- This first step can be used to raise awareness about specific sensitive topics (like cyberbullying)

Step 2:

- Children can create their own website
- Children have to pitch their website in a hackathon style
- Children have to vote for the best project
- The concept of filtering is introduced here

Step 3:

- This stage is more competitive
- The goal is to reproduce the puzzle, children must collect the different pieces
- There are 2 servers: 1 server is slow but give reliable replies, the other server is faster but gives corrupted answers
- Children will not get expected outcomes if they choose rapidity
- The fastest server will be used by children but will lead to a saturation phenomenon
- Introduce black and white list

Step 4:

- DDOS pass through DNS server
- Fake DNS queries sent
- Filtering is embodied by colour code
- Anti-virus filter

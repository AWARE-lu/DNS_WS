# Goal:
Create a 1 hour long game focused on explaining to 16 (max) children aged 8-12 years old divided in 3 groups the basic technical functionning of DNS, how DNS can be controlled, how it can be abused. Focus as much on fun than on technical content.

This WS is a collaborative creation between Savety and Securitymadein.lu. 
Co-Authors (non exhaustive list): 
- Loic Peden (savety)
- Matthieu Farcot (Securitymadein.lu)
- Emilie Muller (Securitymadein.lu)

Project co-financed BY EU, Connecting Europe Facility

# Content

The game is divided in 4 main steps.

## Step 1: Concept introduction, first technical elements, game concepts

- Introduce children to DNS concept as set up in the game (adapt content to age target)
     - [OBJJECTIVE 1] Vulgarize functionning of DNS.
     - [MEAN 1]Use real postal mail analogy. Relate to IP adresses. How can the computer find the right server?
     - [OBJECTIVE 2] Dynamic websites load from various servers in order to generate a single homogeneous content
     - [MEAN 2] Connect to a dynamic website and show audience a Lightbeam outcome : audience need to understand that a dynamic website is loadig from various places. Explain that connecting to Wort.lu (other example?) generates many other connections to various web servers and related data transfer. Use analogy with a tangible shop, only all shops in the street are aware in real time that you went in that shop and can monitor and listen to what you do and say (even geolocalize you in certain situations).

- This first step can be used to raise awareness about specific sensitive topics (like cyberbullying)

## Step 2:

- Children can create their own website
- Children have to pitch their website in a hackathon style
- Children have to vote for the best project
- The concept of filtering is introduced here

## Step 3:

- This stage is more competitive
- The goal is to reproduce the puzzle, children must collect the different pieces
- There are 2 servers: 1 server is slow but give reliable replies, the other server is faster but gives corrupted answers
- Children will not get expected outcomes if they choose rapidity
- The fastest server will be used by children but will lead to a saturation phenomenon
- Introduce black and white list

## Step 4:

- DDOS pass through DNS server
- Fake DNS queries sent
- Filtering is embodied by colour code
- Anti-virus filter

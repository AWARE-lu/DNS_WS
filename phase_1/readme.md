Those files are the logic path for the first phase of the game.

You can display the root.md via a videoprojector.

Then, dispatch to kids 1 to 8 the matching notes.

Then, dispatch to kids 9 to 12 the matching enveloppes.

Then, the 4 remaining kids have to complete the puzzle by following the paths to the pieces via their canonical names:
(ex: to find analytics.savety.lu/probe.png, the kids will have to find the .lu domain via the root displayed, which is the kid #1. Then, by asking kid #1, they'll know that the domain savety.lu is known by kid #5. By asking kid #5, they'll know that the server analytics.savety.lu is the kid #10. So they will be able to ask the requested piece probe.png to the kid #10 who will find it in the analytics.savety.lu enveloppe he has, among others.
